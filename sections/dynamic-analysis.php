            The analysis of computer software that is performed by <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #eee8d5;">executing programs on a real or virtual processor</span>.<br/>
            <br/>
            For dynamic program analysis to be effective,
            <br/>the target program must be executed with <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #eee8d5;">sufficient test inputs</span> to produce interesting behavior.<br/>
            <br/>
            Use of software testing measures such as code coverage helps ensure that an adequate slice of the program's set of possible behaviors has been observed.

        <h2>Callstack</h2>
        <p>
            A callstack is the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #eee8d5;">order</span> in which statements are <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #eee8d5;">exectuted</span>.<br />
            An example commonly known, is an <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #eee8d5;">exception trace</span>. This trace shows all the statements executed before an exception is thrown.

        <h2>Callgraph</h2>
        <p>
            A callgraph is a <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #eee8d5;">visual representation</span> of a callstack.<br />
            In large applications this graph can give you better <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #eee8d5;">insight</span> on how an application is wired.

        <h2>Profiling data</h2>

        <p>
            Usually, the data gathered with a profiler can be represented in stacks or graphs.<br />
            They can include information regarding <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #eee8d5;">memory- and cpu-usage</span>.
