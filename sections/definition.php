            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #eee8d5;">profiling</span> is a form of <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #eee8d5;">dynamic program analysis</span> that <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #eee8d5;">measures</span>, for example, the space (memory) or time complexity of a program,
            the usage of particular instructions, or the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #eee8d5;">frequency and duration of function calls</span>. Most commonly, profiling information serves
            to aid program optimization.
